## More about Bilal Sehgol

Experimenting with technologies I have worked on integrating an award winning human intelligent assistant [TimeSvr](www.timesvr.com) to voice assistants such as Apple's Siri and Google Now.

I have 9 years of experience with user interactivity on software platforms such as [Australia's #1 Property portal](realestate.com.au).

At [NYU Master's in Interactive Telecommunications Program](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp) I used Adobe Suite to create original content; Sketch, Figma, and InVision to prototype UI/UX approaches.

Using physical computing and computational media I also designed for behavior. I have prototyped physical and software interactions such as [Baby Arcade](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B6X02WgVRav2-ldXhJka9qMu80qopMIVvaj4LvIbGTU/edit#slide=id.p)

I am currently learning new technologies such as Javascript, SwiftUI and Databases. I have completed three certificate courses in Front-End Development, Python, and C++ and I look forward to learn new technologies through internship experience.

## Update Author Attributes

In `_config.yml` remember to specify your own data:
    
    title : My Blog =)
    
    author :
      name : Name Lastname
      email : blah@email.test
      github : username
      twitter : username

The theme should reference these variables whenever needed.
    
## Sample Posts

This blog contains sample posts which help stage pages and blog data.
When you don't need the samples anymore just delete the `_posts/core-samples` folder.

    $ rm -rf _posts/core-samples

Here's a sample "posts list".

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## To-Do

This theme is still unfinished. If you'd like to be added as a contributor, [please fork](http://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap)!
We need to clean up the themes, make theme usage guides with theme-specific markup examples.
