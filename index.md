## Looking to intern with you this summer!

I have managed user interactivity on software platforms such as [Australia's #1 Property portal](https://realestate.com.au).

Experimenting with technologies I integrated an award winning human intelligent assistant [TimeSvr](https://www.timesvr.com) with Apple's Siri and Google Now.

At [NYU Master's in Interactive Telecommunications Program](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp) I used Adobe Suite to create original content; Sketch, Figma, and InVision to prototype UI/UX approaches.

Using physical computing and computational media I also designed for behavior. I have prototyped physical and software interactions such as [Baby Arcade](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B6X02WgVRav2-ldXhJka9qMu80qopMIVvaj4LvIbGTU/edit#slide=id.p)

I am learning technologies such as Javascript, SwiftUI and databases (Postgres, Influx). I have completed three certificate courses in Front-End Development, Python, and C++ and I look forward to learn new technologies through internship experience. I have made several websites, mobile apps, browser extensions and I am trained in UI/UX.
